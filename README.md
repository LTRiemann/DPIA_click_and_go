# DPIA_click_and_go
This respository contains the data model in German. The data model in English will follow soon and both versions will be filled with examplary snippets from the BSI (German Federal Office for Information Security). 

Then, the DPIA click&go tool will be published (and explained in great detail) as a docker version (in German). The already provided data model is going to be included to the DPIA click&go tool. The English version will follow soon as well.

Please read the License File carefully.
